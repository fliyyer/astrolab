                <p>RAMADHAN has come, and Sonderlab is proud to once again announce another collaboration with Toko Didiyo for this holy month and season. Mirroring the successful previous Raya collaboration, this time Sonderlab and Toko Didiyo is back to embrace the purity and tranquillity, and both came up with perfect pieces to be part of the Exclusive Collection.</p>
                <p>The idea was also to provide modernity in modest wear, more options for people who seeks for unique pieces to wear during this holy month, yet still reflects the beauty, grace – every essence of Ramadhan month.</p>
                <p>Aiming to deliver more modest pieces, Toko Didiyo has fused their signature touch of delicate embroidery and lace, where the “White Serenity” collection was finally born. Beautifully designed and made, its pieces will definitely invite individuals, luring them to a sense of inner peace and serenity during the holy month of Ramadan, and experience that feeling whenever wearing pieces from the “White Serenity” collection.</p>
                <p>Toko Didiyo also put unexpected details, where they aim to create garments that resonate with the essence of Ramadhan while embracing modernity and individuality. Featuring an array of garments crafted with embroidered cotton and lace, the chosen colour for “White Serenity” also holds special meaning related to the holiness of Ramadhan, where the colour white represents purity, cleanliness, and simplicity, which are central themes and holds symbolic significance of the holy month. Alongside white, the colour black was also chosen as it represents modesty, dignity, and solemnity according to several cultures, including the Muslim community.</p>
                <p>As most people is generally known to choose white during Ramadan for to symbolize purity, during the holy month, some individuals may choose to wear black clothing as a sign of respect for the sanctity of the month and as a way to maintain a sense of humility and focus on spiritual reflection. Hence, Toko Didiyo believes that both colours hold their own symbolic significance in this holy month of Ramadhan.</p>
